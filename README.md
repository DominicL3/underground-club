# 🤫 The Underground Club 🕳️🎶

Play here: [underground-club.xyz](https://underground-club.xyz)

The Underground Club is a web-based riddle. Users are asked to input a word or phrase, and the game will tell them if their guess would be allowed into the Underground Club.

I first learned of this devious little game on a ski trip where it took me 1.5 days to solve. Now I bring this pain to you.

There is no end state for the game yet, because you "win" by figuring out the rule. Maybe you can hook up an LLM to verify you've got the rule but that seems like overkill.

## Project Structure

Written with vanilla HTML, Javascript, and CSS, and deployed to Cloudflare Pages. I have very little experience in webdev, so this code is super spaghetti 🍝

## Inspect source
If you do this, you're a loser.
